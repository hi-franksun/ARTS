Technical Writing One teaches you how to write clearer technical documentation.

## Target audience(听众、读者)

You need at least a little writing proficiency in English, but you don't need to be a strong writer to take this course.

If you've never taken any technical writing training, this course is perfect for you. If you've taken technical writing training, this class provides an efficient refresher.

## Learning objectives(目标)

This course teaches you the fundamentals(基本、基本原理) of technical writing. After completing this class, you will know how to do the following:

*   Use terminology(术语)—including abbreviations(缩写) and acronyms—consistently(首字母缩写).
*   Recognize and disambiguate pesky pronouns.(识别并消除讨厌的代词)
*   Distinguish active voice from passive voice.(区分主动语态与被动语态)
*   Convert passive voice sentences to active voice.(将被动语态句子转换为主动语态)
*   Identify three ways in which active voice is superior(优于，好过) to passive voice.
*   Develop at least three strategies to make sentences clearer and more engaging.(制定至少三种策略，使句子更清晰、更吸引人。)
*   Develop at least four strategies(策略、手段、方法) to shorten sentences(句子).
*   Understand the difference between bulleted(项目) lists and numbered(数字) lists.

It takes years of focused practice(专注练习) to become a great engineer or a great technical writer. This course will improve your technical writing but will not instantly transform you into a great technical writer.

## Pre\-class and in\-class components

The course consists of the following two components:

*   pre\-class
*   in\-class

You are currently viewing the start of the pre\-class component.

The in\-class component enhances the lessons taught in the pre\-class components. That said, the pre\-class lessons on their own still provide a valuable educational experience.

## Hardware and network requirements

Although this course is optimized for a laptop or desktop, you may take the course on a tablet or phone. If you are taking the in\-class component, please note that you'll type a lot.

You need an internet connection to take the course. You cannot download the course. The course is not available on tangible media.

The course contains a few short videos, all of which are optional viewing. If you want to skip the videos, then you can take the course on a low\-bandwidth internet connection.

## Optional units(可选单元)

We've marked a few units as **optional**. This material isn't essential, though you'll probably find the material useful.

**Next unit:** [Just enough grammar](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/just-enough-grammar), an optional unit

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

This unit provides just enough grammar to understand the remainder of the course. If you already know some grammar, move on to [Words](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/words). Otherwise, read on.

For simplicity's sake, this unit takes a few shortcuts; grammatical topics are actually wildly more complicated than this unit suggests.

Grammarians don't all agree on the number or types of parts of speech(言语、发言). The following table focuses on the parts of speech relevant to this course:

| Part of Speech | Definition | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Noun(名词) | a person, place, concept(概念), or thing | **Sam** runs **races**. |
| Pronoun(代名词) | a noun that substitutes(代替、替换) for another noun | Sam runs races. **He** likes to compete. |
| Adjective(形容词) | a word or phrase(短语，词组) that modifies(修饰、装饰) a noun | Sam wears **blue** shoes. |
| Verb(动词) | an action word or phrase | Sam **runs** races. |
| Adverb(副词) | a word or phrase that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb | Sam runs **slowly**. |
| Preposition(介词) | a word or phrase specifying the positional relationship of two nouns | Sam's sneakers are seldom **on** his shelf. |
| Conjunction(连接词) | a word that connects two nouns or phrases | Sam's trophies **and** ribbons live only in his imagination. |
| Transition(过度词) | a word or phrase that connects two sentences | Sam runs races weekly. **However**, he finishes races weakly. |

## Nouns

Nouns represent(represent) people, places, or things. **Judy**, **Antarctica**, and **hammers** are all nouns, but so are intangible(无形) concepts like **robustness(robustness )** and **perfection**. For example, we've highlighted the nouns in the following passage(通道、段落、走廊、过道):

> In the **framework**, an **object** must copy any underlying **values** that the **object** wants to change. The **protos** in the **codebase** are huge, so copying the **protos** is unacceptably expensive.

In programming, you might think of classes and variables as your program's nouns.

### Exercise

Identify the six nouns in the following passage:

> C enables programmers to control pointers and memory. Great power brings great responsibility.

#### Click the icon to see the answer.

You can find the nouns in boldface:

> **C** enables **programmers** to control **pointers** and **memory**. Great **power** brings great **responsibility**.

Now suppose the second sentence was the following:

> Great control brings great responsibility.

Is "control" a verb or is it a noun?

In this context(语境、上下文), "control" is a noun, even though "to control" in the first sentence is a verb. Many words in English serve as a noun in some contexts and a verb in others.

## Pronouns

Pronouns are an indirection layer—pointers to or substitutions for other nouns or sentences. For example, consider the following two sentences:

> Janet writes great code. **She** is a senior(高级) staff(员工) engineer.

In the preceding(上一个) example, the first sentence establishes(建立、确立) **Janet** as a noun. The second sentence substitutes(替代) the pronoun **She** for the noun **Janet**.

In the following example, the pronoun **This** substitutes for the entire(全部) sentence that preceded(先于、之前) it:

> Most applications aren't sufficiently tested. **This** is poor engineering.(大多数应用都没有经过充分的测试。这是糟糕的工程。)

### Exercise

Identify the three pronouns in the following passage:

> The cafeteria featured peashew butter and pluot jam on pumperye toast. Employees found it awesome and wished they could eat this every day.

> The cafeteria featured peashew butter and pluot jam on pumperye toast. Employees found **it** awesome and wished **they** could eat **this** every day.

## Verbs

A verb is an action word or phrase. When you want to represent the relationship between two nouns (an actor and a target), the verb does the work. A verb identifies what the actor does to the target.

Each sentence must contain at least one verb. For example, each of the following sentences contain a single verb:

*   Sakai **prefers** pasta.
*   Rick **likes** the ocean.
*   Smurfs **are** blue.
*   Jess **suffers** from allergies.

Some sentences, such as the following, contain multiple verbs:

*   Nala **suffers** from allergies and **sneezes** constantly.
*   Chung **likes** snacks **to eat** while **riding** the train.

Depending on the tense and the conjugation, a verb could consist of one word or multiple words. For example:

*   Tina **was eating** breakfast a few hours ago.
*   Tina **is eating** lunch right now.
*   Tina **will eat** dinner tonight at 7:00.

### Exercise

Identify the verbs in the following passage:

> Samantha is coding Operation Bullwinkle in C++. This project currently consumes over 80,000 lines of code. She previously used Python, but recently gravitated to C++. Samantha leads a team of four software engineers, which will grow to six software engineers next quarter.

#### Click the icon to see the answer.

> Samantha **is coding** Operation Bullwinkle in C++. This project currently **consumes** over 80,000 lines of code. She previously **used** Python, but recently **gravitated** to C++. Samantha **leads** a team of four software engineers, which **will grow** to six software engineers next quarter.

## Adjectives and adverbs

Adjectives modify nouns. For example, in the following passage, notice how the adjectives modify the subsequent noun:

*   Tom likes **red** balloons. He prepares **delicious** food. He fixed **eight** bugs at work.

Most adverbs modify verbs. For example, notice how the adverb ( **efficiently**) in the following sentence modifies the verb (**fixes**):

*   Jane **efficiently** fixes bugs.

Adverbs are not necessarily right next to their verb. For example, in the following sentence, the adverb (**efficiently**) is two words away from the verb (**fixes**):

*   Jane fixes bugs **efficiently**.

Adverbs can also modify adjectives or other adverbs.

### Exercise

Identify the four adjectives in the following passage:

> Engineering is a great career for brilliant minds. I know five engineers who could excel at any intellectual task.

#### Click the icon to see the answer.

> Engineering is a **great** career for **brilliant** minds. I know **five** engineers who could excel at any **intellectual** task.

## Conjunctions and transitions

Conjunctions connect phrases or nouns *within* a sentence; transitions connect sentences themselves.

The most important conjunctions are as follows:

*   and
*   but
*   or

For example, in the following sentence, **and** connects "code" with "documentation," while **but** connects the first half of the sentence with the second.

> Natasha writes great internal code **and** documentation **but** seldom works on open\-source projects.

The most important transitions in technical writing are as follows:

*   however
*   therefore
*   for example

For example, in the following passage, notice how the transitions connect and contextualize the sentences:

> Juan is a wonderful coder. **However**, he rarely writes sufficient tests. **For example**, Juan coded a 5,000 line FFT package that contained only a single 10\-line unit test.

### Exercise

Fill in the most appropriate transition:

> Barbara typically studies problems for a long time before writing the first line of code. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, she spontaneously coded a method the other day when she was suddenly inspired.
