I try to write using ordinary words and simple sentences.

我尽量用普通的文字和简单的句子来写。



That kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. The less energy they expend(支出) on your prose(散文), the more they'll have left for your ideas.

那样的文章更容易读懂，而越容易读懂的东西，读者就会越深入地参与其中。他们在你的散文上花费的精力越少，就会有更多的精力留给你的想法。



And the further(进一步) they'll read. Most readers' energy tends(趋向) to flag part way through an article or essay. If the friction of reading is low enough, more keep going till the end.

他们就会越读越远。大多数读者的精力往往会在一篇文章或文章的一半时间里旗帜鲜明。如果阅读的摩擦力足够低，更多的人会一直读到最后。



There's an Italian dish(菜) called _saltimbocca_, which means "leap(飞入) into the mouth." My goal when writing might be called _saltintesta_: the ideas leap into your head and you barely(仅仅) notice the words that got them there.

有一道意大利菜叫saltimbocca，意思是 "跃入口中"。我写作时的目标可能被称为saltintesta：想法跃入你的脑海，你几乎没有注意到让它们出现的文字。



It's too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. You might not even want it to be. But for most writers, most of the time, that's the goal to aim for. The gap between most writing and pure ideas is not filled with poetry(诗歌).

这是太多的希望，写作可以永远是纯粹的想法。你可能甚至不希望它是。但对于大多数作家来说，大多数时候，这才是要追求的目标。大多数写作与纯思想之间的差距，不是用诗歌来填补的



Plus it's more considerate to write simply. When you write in a fancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just so you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train behind you that readers have to carry.

另外，简单的写法更有体贴之处。当你为了给别人留下深刻印象而写得花里胡哨时，你是在让他们做额外的工作，只是为了让你看起来很酷。这就像在你身后拖着一列长长的火车，读者必须要背着它。



And remember, if you're writing in English, that a lot of your readers won't be native English speakers. Their understanding of ideas may be way ahead of their understanding of English. So you can't assume(认为) that writing about a difficult topic means you can use difficult words.

记住，如果你是用英语写作，你的很多读者不会是以英语为母语的人。他们对想法的理解可能远远超过他们对英语的理解。所以你不能认为写一个困难的话题就意味着你可以使用困难的词汇。



Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal(隐藏) ideas. It can also conceal the lack of them. That's why some people write that way, to conceal the fact that they have nothing to say. Whereas writing simply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be obvious to everyone, including you.

当然，花哨的文字并不只是掩盖想法。它还可以掩盖没有想法的事实。所以有些人这样写，是为了掩饰自己无话可说的事实。而写作却能简单地让你保持诚实。如果你简单地什么都不说，就会被所有人看出来，包括你自己。



Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in the future will be in much the same position as people from other countries reading it today. The culture and the language will have changed. It's not vain to care about that, any more than it's vain for a woodworker to build a chair to last.

简单的文字也比较持久。将来读你的东西的人和今天读你的东西的其他国家的人的处境是差不多的。文化和语言都会发生变化。关心这些并不虚，就像木匠造一把椅子要长久一样，也不虚。



Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental quality of chairs, or writing. It's a sign you did a good job.

事实上，持久不仅仅是椅子的偶然品质，也不仅仅是写作。它是你做得很好的标志。



But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, none of them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that it offends me not to. When I write a sentence that seems too complicated, or that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy to me. It seems clumsy(笨拙的).

不过，虽然这些都是简单写作的实际好处，但都不是我为什么要写的原因。我写得简单的主要原因是，不写我就不爽。当我写的句子看起来太复杂，或者使用了不必要的知识性词语，在我看来并不花哨。它看起来很笨拙。



There are of course times when you want to use a complicated sentence or fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by accident.

当然有的时候，你想用复杂的句子或花哨的词来达到效果。但你千万不要偶然这样做。



The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do it. I write the first draft fast, then spend days editing it, trying to get everything just right. Much of this editing is cutting, and that makes simple writing even simpler.

我的写作最终变得简单的另一个原因是我的写作方式。我快速地写出初稿，然后花上几天时间进行编辑，试图让一切都恰到好处。这种编辑大部分是剪裁，这让简单的写作变得更加简单。
