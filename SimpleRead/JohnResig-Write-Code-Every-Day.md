Last fall, work on my [coding side projects](https://github.com/jeresig) (side-project:副业，其实就是个人项目的意思，除了工作之外)came to a head: I wasn’t making adequate(足够充分) progress and I couldn’t find a way to get more done without sacrificing(牺牲) my ability to do effective work at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).

去年秋天，我的编码方面项目的工作即将结束，我没有取得足够的进度，我找不到不能在不牺牲个人在 Khan Academy 工作的情况下来完成更多的工作！

There were a few major problems with how I was working on my side projects. I was primarily working on them during the weekends and sometimes in the evenings during the week. This is a strategy(策略、手段) that does not work well for me, as it turns out(恰好). I was burdened with an incredible amount of stress to try and complete as much high quality work as possible during the weekend (and if I was unable to it felt like a failure). This was a problem as there’s no guarantee that every weekend will be free – nor that I’ll want to program all day for two days (removing any chance of relaxation or doing anything fun).

我的副业工作方式有几个大问题。我主要是在周末工作，有时在一周内的晚上工作。事实证明，这种策略对我来说并不奏效。我承受着巨大的压力，试图在周末完成尽可能多的高质量的工作（如果我不能完成，就会觉得自己很失败）。这是一个问题，因为不能保证每个周末都是空闲的--也不能保证我会想在两天内整天编程（除去任何放松或做任何有趣事情的机会）。



There’s also the issue that a week between working on some code is a long time, it’s very easy to forget what you were working on or what you left off on (even if you keep notes). Not to mention if you miss a weekend you end up with a two week gap as a result. That massive multi-week context switch can be deadly (I’ve had many side projects die due to attention starvation like that).

还存在一个问题，即在编写某些代码之间需要花费一个星期的时间，很容易忘记您正在处理的内容或遗忘的内容（即使您记笔记）。更不用说如果您错过了一个周末，结果将导致两个星期的间隔。如此巨大的为期数周的上下文切换可能是致命的（由于类似这样的关注饥饿，我有很多附带项目都死掉了）。



Inspired by the incredible work that [Jennifer Dewalt](http://jenniferdewalt.com/) completed last year, in which she taught herself programming by building 180 web sites in 180 days, I felt compelled to try a similar tactic: working on my side projects every single day.

詹妮弗·迪瓦特（Jennifer Dewalt）去年完成了令人难以置信的工作，她在180天内建立了180个网站，从而自学编程，这激发了我的灵感，我感到必须尝试类似的策略：每天都在我的辅助项目上工作。



I decided to set a couple rules for myself:

1. I must write code every day. I can write docs, or blog posts, or other things but it must be in addition to(其他的，除了，此外) the code that I write.

   我必须每天写代码。我可以编写文档，博客文章或其他内容，但它必须是我编写的代码之外的内容。

   

2. It must be useful code. No tweaking indentation, no code re-formatting, and if at all possible no refactoring. (All these things are permitted, but not as the exclusive work of the day.)

   它必须是有用的代码。没有调整缩进，没有代码重新格式化，并且即使有可能也没有重构。 （所有这些事情都是允许的，但不能作为一天的专有工作。）

3. All code must be written before midnight.

4. The code must be Open Source and up on Github.

Some of these rules were arbitrary. The code doesn’t technically need to be written before midnight of the day of but I wanted to avoid staying up too late writing sloppy code. Neither does the code have to be Open Source or up on Github. This just forced me to be more mindful of the code that I was writing (thinking about reusability and deciding to create modules earlier in the process).

其中一些规则是任意的。从技术上讲，不需要在当天的午夜之前编写代码，但我想避免熬夜写草率的代码。代码既不必是开源的，也不必在Github上运行。这只是迫使我更加注意自己正在编写的代码（考虑可重用性，并决定在过程中更早地创建模块）。



Thus far I’ve been very successful, I’m nearing 20 weeks of consecutive work. I wanted to write about it as it’s completely changed how I code and has had a substantial impact upon my life and psyche.

到目前为止，我非常成功，我已经接近连续工作20周了。我想写一下，因为它完全改变了我的编码方式，对我的生活和心理产生了实质性的影响。

With this in mind a number of interesting things happened as a result of this change in habit:

**Minimum viable code.** I was forced to write code for no less than 30 minutes a day. (It’s really hard to write meaningful code in less time, especially after remembering where you left off(离开) the day before.) Some week days I work a little bit more (usually no more than an hour) and on weekends I’m sometimes able to work a full day.

**最小可行的代码.**我被迫每天写代码不少于30分钟。(在更短的时间内写出有意义的代码真的很难，尤其是在记得前一天你离开的地方(离开)之后。) 有些工作日我会多工作一点（通常不超过一个小时），周末我有时能工作一整天。



**Code as habit.** It’s important to note that that I don’t particularly(尤其，特别) care about the outward perception of the above Github chart. I think that’s the most important take away from this experiment: this is about a change that you’re making in your life for yourself not a change that you’re making to satisfy someone else’s perception of your work. The same goes for any form of dieting or exercise: if you don’t care about improving yourself then you’ll never actually succeed.

**代码为习惯.**需要注意的是，我并不是特别在意上面Github图的外在认知。我认为这是这个实验最重要的收获：这是你为自己在生活中做出的改变，而不是为了满足别人对你工作的看法而做出的改变。任何形式的节食或运动都是一样的：如果你不关心改善自己，那么你永远不会真正成功。



**Battling anxiety.**(对抗焦虑) Prior to starting this experiment I would frequently feel a high level of anxiety over not having completed “enough” work or made “enough” progress (both of which are relatively unquantifiable as my side projects had no specific deadlines). I realized that **the _feeling_ of making progress is just as important as making actual progress**. This was an eye-opener. Once I started to make consistent progress every day the anxiety started to melt away. I felt at peace with the amount of work that I was getting done and I no longer had the over-bearing desire to frantically get any work done.

在开始这个实验之前，我经常会因为没有完成 "足够 "的工作或没有取得 "足够 "的进展而感到高度焦虑（这两者都是相对不可量化的，因为我的副业项目没有具体的期限）。我意识到，取得进展的感觉与取得实际进展同样重要。这让我大开眼界。一旦我开始每天持续取得进展，焦虑就开始融化。我对自己所完成的工作量感到平静，我不再有过度的欲望去疯狂地完成任何工作。



**Weekends.** Getting work done on weekends use to be absolutely critical towards making forward momentum (as they were, typically, the only time in which I got significant side project coding done). That’s not so much the case now – and that’s a good thing. Building up a weeks-worth of expectations about what I should accomplish during the weekend only ended up leaving me disappointed. I was rarely able to complete all the work that I wanted and it forced me to reject other weekend activities that I enjoyed (eating dim sum, visiting museums, going to the park, spending time with my partner, etc.) in favor of getting more work done. I strongly feel that while side projects are really important they should not be to the exclusion of life in general.

周末。在周末完成工作曾经是取得前进动力的绝对关键（因为周末通常是我完成重要的副项目编码的唯一时间）。现在情况不一样了--这是件好事。建立了一个星期的期望，关于我应该在周末完成什么，最终只会让我失望。我很少能够完成所有我想要的工作，这迫使我拒绝了其他我喜欢的周末活动（吃点心、参观博物馆、去公园、和我的伴侣共度时光等等），而去完成更多的工作。我强烈地感觉到，虽然副业真的很重要，但它们不应该排斥一般的生活。



**Background processing.** An interesting side effect of writing side project code every day is that your current task is frequently(经常) running in the back of your mind. Thus when I go for a walk, or take a shower, or any of the other non-brain-using activities I participate in, I’m thinking about what I’m going to be coding later and finding a good way to solve that problem. This did not happen when I was working on the code once a week, or every other week. Instead that time was consumed thinking about some other task or, usually, replaced with anxiety(焦虑) over not getting any side project work done.

**后台处理.**每天写副项目代码的一个有趣的副作用是，你当前的任务经常(经常)在脑海中运行。因此，当我去散步，或者洗澡，或者其他任何我参加的非用脑活动时，我都在思考我待会儿要编码的内容，并找到解决这个问题的好方法。当我每周工作一次，或者每隔一周工作一次的时候，这种情况并没有发生。相反，这些时间被消耗在思考其他任务上，或者，通常被没有完成任何副项目工作的焦虑所取代。



**Context switch.** There’s always going to be a context switch cost when resuming(恢复) work on a side project. Unfortunately it’s extremely hard to resume thinking about a project after an entire week of working on another task. Daily work has been quite helpful in this regard as the time period between work is much shorter, making it easier to remember what I was working on.

在恢复副业项目的工作时，总是会有一个上下文切换的成本。不幸的是，在整整一周的工作后，要恢复思考一个项目是非常困难的。日常工作在这方面有相当大的帮助，因为工作之间的时间段更短，使我更容易记住我在做什么。



**Work balance.** One of the most important aspects(层面、方面) of this change was in simply learning how to better balance work/life/side project. Knowing that I was going to _have to_ work on the project every single day I had to get better at balancing my time. If I was scheduled to go out in the evening, and not get back until late, then I would need to work on my side project early in the day, before starting my main Khan Academy work. Additionally if I hadn’t finished my work yet, and I was out late, then I’d hurry back home to finish it up (instead of missing a day). I should note that I’ve been finding that I have less time to spend on hobbies (such as woodblock printing) but that’s a reasonable tradeoff(权衡) that I’ll need to live with.

这种变化最重要的一个方面就是学会如何更好地平衡工作/生活/兼职项目。我知道我每天都要为这个项目工作，我必须更好地平衡我的时间。如果我被安排在晚上出去，直到很晚才回来，那么我就需要在一天中很早的时候，在开始我的主要可汗学院工作之前，先做我的副项目。另外如果我还没有完成工作，而我又很晚才出去，那么我会赶紧回家完成工作（而不是错过一天）。我应该注意到，我发现我花在爱好上的时间越来越少了（比如木版画），但这是一个合理的权衡（权衡），我需要接受。



**Outward perception.** (外在感受、外在形象)This has all had the added benefit of communicating this new habit externally. My partner understands that I have to finish this work every day, and thus activities sometimes have to be scheduled around it. It’s of considerable comfort to be able to say “Yes, we can go out/watch a movie/etc. but I have to get my coding in later” and have that be understood and taken into consideration.

他的这一切都有一个额外的好处，那就是将这个新习惯对外传达。我的伴侣明白，我每天都要完成这项工作，因此有时必须围绕它安排活动。能够说 "是的，我们可以出去玩/看电影/等等，但是我必须在以后把我的编码工作做完"，并且能够理解和考虑到这一点，这是个相当大的安慰。



**How much code was written?** I have a hard time believing how much code I’ve written over the past few months. I created a couple new web sites, re-wrote some frameworks, and created a ton of new node modules. I’ve written so much I sometimes forget the things I’ve made – work from even a few weeks prior seem like a distant memory. I’m extremely pleased with the amount of work that I’ve gotten done.

我很难相信我在过去几个月里写了多少代码。我创建了几个新的网站，重写了一些框架，并创建了一大堆新的节点模块。我写了这么多，有时会忘记我做的事情--甚至几个星期前的工作都好像是遥远的记忆。我对自己完成的工作量非常满意。



I consider(思考、考虑) this change in habit to be a massive(大、大量) success and hope to continue it for as long as I can. In the meantime I’ll do all that I can to recommend this tactic(战术) to others who wish to get substantial(重大、丰富、实用、实惠) side project work done. [Let me know](https://johnresig.com/about/) if this technique does, or doesn’t, work for you – I’m very interested in hearing additional(额外) anecdotes(轶事)!

我认为这种习惯的改变是一个巨大的成功，并希望能尽可能地继续下去。同时，我会尽我所能向其他希望完成实质性副项目工作的人推荐这种策略。如果这种技巧对你有用，或者没用，请告诉我--我非常有兴趣听到更多的轶事!
